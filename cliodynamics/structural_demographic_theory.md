# Structural Demographic Theory

__Goal:__ understand and predict the dynamics of sociopolitical instability

Human societies as systems with three societal components + one process component, each interacting with each other:

societal components
  * **the general population**, 
    * numbers = f(incomes, consumption, social optimism, instability)
    * age structure = f(population growth rates, instability)
    * urbanization = f(population growth rates) 
  * **the elites**, and 
    * numbers = f(incomes, consumption, social optimism, instability + social mobility)
    * composition (inherited, new, aspirant, counter) = f(?)
    * incomes = f(economic conjuncture, elite numbers, state expenditure)
    * wealth = f(?)  
  * **the state**.
    * size = f(number of state employee, GDP percent going to state)
    * revenues
    * expenditures
    * debt
    * legitimacy
  
process component:
  * **instability**  
    * size
    * growth

Population growth in excess of the productivity gains of the land has several effects on social institutions:

1) Persistent price inflation which imply falling real wages, rural misery, urban migration, and increased frequency of food riots and wage protests. 

2) Elite overproduction: an increased number of aspirants for the limited supply of elite positions. 
Intra-elite competition leads to the formation of rival patronage networks vying for state rewards. 
As a result, elites become riven by increasing rivalry and factionalism. 

3) Expansion of the army and the bureaucracy and to rising real costs. 

States have no choice but to seek to expand taxation, despite resistance from the elites and the general populace. 
Yet, attempts to increase revenues cannot offset the spiraling state expenses. 
Thus, even if the state succeeds in raising taxes, it is still headed for fiscal crisis. 
As all these trends intensify, the end result is state bankruptcy and consequent loss of military control; 
elite movements of regional and national rebellion; and a combination of elite-mobilized and popular uprisings that expose the breakdown of central authority.

# Principal causes of heightened instability:

1) overpopulation: supply of labor exceeds its demand, the price of labor decreases, depressing the living standards for the majority of population, thus leading to popular immiseration (economic impoverishment), but creating favorable economic conditions for the elites.
2) fiscal crisis
3) **elite overproduction**

# Cessation of political instability 

Overpopulation is reversed (Malthusianism) + the conditions of elite overproduction no longer obtain. 

# Maths

## &psi; PSI

Political Stress Indicator: the lower the better.

&psi; = MMP x EMP x SFD

 * MMP: mass mobilization potential (popular distress)
 * EMP: elite mobilization potential
 * SFD: state fiscal deficit (distress)
 
MMP = w<sup>-1</sup> (<sup>N<sub>urb</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>N</sub>) A<sub>20-29</sub>	

 * w<sup>-1</sup> = 1 / w = inverse relative wage üëâ more wage will lower the MMP 
 * N: total population
 * N<sub>urb</sub>: Population living in cities
 * A<sub>20-29</sub>: Proportion of population aged between 20 and 29
 
EMP = &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup> (<sup>E</sup>&frasl;<sub>sN</sub>) = &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup> e

 * &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup>: inverse relative elite income scaled by GDP per capita2: more income means a lower &epsilon;<sup>-1</sup> which means less intra-elite competition and thus lower the EMP.
 * E: Elite number
 * s: number of government employess / per total population (constant)
 * e = <sup>E</sup>&frasl;<sub>N</sub>: relative number of elite
 
 SFD = <sup>Y</sup>&frasl;<sub>G</sub> (1 - T)
 
  * Y: total state debt
  * G: GDP
  * T: percentage of population trusting government and thus (1 - T) is the percentage of population dis-trusting government
 
## W: model for the dynamics of real (nfaltion-adjusted ) wages

W = f(GDP<sub>pc</sub>, D/S, C)

 * GDP<sub>pc</sub>: gross domestic product per capita. It is calculated as <sup>G</sup>&frasl;<sub>N</sub> (G, N defined above).
 * D: Demand of labor, i.e., number of jobs üí° GDP divided by average worker productivity
 * S: Supply of labor, i.e., number of people who would like to work
 * C: "Culture" as in non-economic sources of social power: coercice, political and ideological (power relations). ‚ùì
