# Structural Demographic Theory

Population growth in excess of the productivity gains of the land has several effects on social institutions:

1) Persistent price inflation which imply falling real wages, rural misery, urban migration, and increased frequency of food riots and wage protests. 

2) Elite overproduction: an increased number of aspirants for the limited supply of elite positions. 
Intra-elite competition leads to the formation of rival patronage networks vying for state rewards. 
As a result, elites become riven by increasing rivalry and factionalism. 

3) Expansion of the army and the bureaucracy and to rising real costs. 

States have no choice but to seek to expand taxation, despite resistance from the elites and the general populace. 
Yet, attempts to increase revenues cannot offset the spiraling state expenses. 
Thus, even if the state succeeds in raising taxes, it is still headed for fiscal crisis. 
As all these trends intensify, the end result is state bankruptcy and consequent loss of military control; 
elite movements of regional and national rebellion; and a combination of elite-mobilized and popular uprisings that expose the breakdown of central authority.
