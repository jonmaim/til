# Malthusian catastrophe

Malthusianism is the idea that population growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply or other resources is linear, which eventually reduces living standards to the point of triggering a population die off. 

A Malthusian catastrophe occurs when population growth outpaces agricultural production, causing population to be limited by famine or war.
