# Cliodynamics

Always has been big fan of Asimov's foundation series which among others describe the psychohistory: 
a science that allows to predict History trends with much exactitude.

 Now I read [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/) 
 about Peter Turchin and the new science he coined: cliodynamics, which looks pretty similar in purpose to psychohistory.
 
 Like Hari Seldon, the inventor of psychohistory, Peter Turchin's ego looks bigger than life. 
 
 Cliodynamics is the process of studying past societies, populating databases and deriving a mathematical model able to predict a specific trend. 
 In particular, Turchin has realised a model for state collapse based on elite overpopulation.
