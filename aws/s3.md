## Restore objects deleted in a versioned bucket

In our use-case, all deleted object after a specific date have to be restored. 
Each deleted object has at least one `deleted marker` version associated with it that needs to be deleted.

```bash
pip install boto3
```

The following python code has been adapted from this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54613767/418831).

```python
import boto3
import botocore
import datetime
import pytz

bucket_name = 'mybucket'

session = boto3.Session(profile_name='choose-profile-from-aws-credentials-file')
s3 = session.resource('s3')
bucket = s3.Bucket(bucket_name)

versions = bucket.object_versions

total_files = 0
total_deleted_files = 0

for version in versions.all():
    try:
        total_files = total_files + 1
        version.head()
    except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
        headers = e.response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPHeaders']
        if 'x-amz-delete-marker' in headers:
            # all objects after June 12 needs to be restored
            if datetime.datetime(2020, 5, 12, tzinfo=pytz.UTC) < version.last_modified:
                print('delete marker 🍎', version.last_modified, version, '#', total_files);
                version.delete()
                total_deleted_files = total_deleted_files + 1

print('deleted files:', total_deleted_files, '/', total_files)
```
